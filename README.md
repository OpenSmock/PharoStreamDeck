## Contents of this GitHub repository
### Stream Deck Pharo Profile
This project shows how Stream Deck buttons can interact with the Pharo IDE by using some dedicated keyboard shortcuts.

### Basic WebSocket communication
This project shows a Web page programmed in HTML and JavaScript can communicate with a server programmed in Pharo by using a WebSocket and JSON data.

### Plugins
This folder, which contains the PharoStreamDeck plugin, shows how a plugin made in Pharo can interact with the Stream Deck, where values can be selected with the plugin (and the dedicated Stream Deck profile available alongside it). \
A JavaScript version for selecting a year value also exists, made entirely in JavaScript
